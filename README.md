# Face Detection with OpenCV in Python

This script uses OpenCV to detect human faces in an image and draw rectangle around them. 
The properties of the rectangle are displayed above the rectangle.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: 

`git clone https://github.com/ironlam/face-detection.git`

2. Move to the directory:

`cd face-detection`

3. Install the required packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


4. Run the script:

`python main.py`

5. The output image will be displayed showing the rectangles around the faces.

## Note

Make sure that the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is in the same directory as the script. The file can be downloaded from [the OpenCV repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).
